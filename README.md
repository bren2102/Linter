# Linter Project

The purpose of this project is to create a linter that parses file data and informs of format errors. It's a linter for beginners, i.e. it provides feedback about errors or warning in code little by little.

## Built With

- Ruby

## Instructions

This version of the XML Begginer linter reads the ./doc.xml file included in the project. This XML file linter will evaluate the following syntax correct:

- If the XML prolog exists, must be first in the document.
- If the XML prolog exists, must have the correct structure which includes '?' at the beggining and at the end of the tag
- If there is no closing tag in an inline node
- If the starting and ending tags don't match because are case sensitive. The tag 'Director' is different from the tag 'director'.
- If the XML tags are empty inside < tag > < tag >
- if there are attribute values, these must always be quoted:
- If there is a multiline node, must have starting and ending tag

- Linter passes all tests

- Linter fails most of the tests

## How to use

Clone or download this repository to have the linter on your computer.

- If you need help cloning this repo, check more info [HERE](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

- If you want to download it directly instead, go on the project's Github page, click on "Clone or download", and then on "Download ZIP". After this you need to extract the contents of the zip file on your computer.
Once you have the files on your computer, go on the command line and navigate to the game directory. Once there :

Change the content of the doc.xml file to suit your testing needs
Run the linter directly from the executable file, using the command ./bin/index.rb
Pass the index.rb file to the ruby interpreter, using the command ruby bin/index.rb

## Use Examples

```
- If the XML prolog exists must have the correct structure at the beggining and the end
```xml
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>              [Correct]

  <xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8">                [Incorrect] [ERROR] Malformed atributes. Missing quotes
```
- In XML, it is illegal to omit the closing tag. All elements must have a closing tag
```xml
  <Year>2015</Year>                                   [Correct]
  
  <Year>2015                                          [Incorrect]
```
- XML tags are case sensitive. The tag 'Director' is different from the tag 'director'.
```xml
  <Director>George .S .Miller</Director>              [Correct]
  
  <Director>George .S .Miller</director>              [Incorrect]
```
- XML tags must contain text inside.
```xml
  <Actor character = "Dr Brand">Michael Caine</Actor> [Correct]
  
  <Actor character = "Dr Brand"></Actor>              [Incorrect]
```
- In XML, the attribute values must always be quoted:
```xml
  <note date="12/11/2007">
  <to>Tove</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
  </note>                                             [Correct]
  
  <note date=12/11/2007>
  <to>Tove</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
  </note>                                             [Incorrect]
```
- Multiline nodes must always have a starting and ending tag
```xml
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <note>
  <to>Tove</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
  <heading>Reminder</heading>
  <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
  </note>                                             [Correct]

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <note>
  <to>Tove</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
  <heading>Reminder</heading>
  <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>          [Incorrect]
```
